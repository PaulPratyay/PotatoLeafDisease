# Potato_Leaf_Disease
### This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and classify potato leaf diseases from image data. It aims to assist in early detection of common potato diseases such as Early Blight and Late Blight, as well as identify healthy leaves, using deep learning techniques built with TensorFlow and Keras.
