# Potato_Leaf_Disease
### This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and classify potato leaf diseases from image data. It aims to assist in early detection of common potato diseases such as Early Blight and Late Blight, as well as identify healthy leaves, using deep learning techniques built with TensorFlow and Keras.

## 🚀 Key Features

* Trained CNN models to classify potato leaf diseases from image data
* Compared multiple model architectures to improve accuracy and reliability
* Applied preprocessing, augmentation, and visualization techniques for enhanced learning
* Visualized model performance using training/validation accuracy and loss graphs

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow & Keras
* OpenCV (for image handling)
* NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

## 🗂️ Dataset
* The dataset includes three categories:
  * Potato___Early_blight
  * Potato___Late_blight
  * Potato___healthy
* Split into train/ and val/ directories for model training and evaluation

*Dataset Source*: PlantVillage Dataset
